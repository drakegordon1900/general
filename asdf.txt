Local media, including NHK and the Kyodo news agency, earlier said Abe appeared to be in "cardiorespiratory arrest", a term often used in Japan before a feared death can be officially confirmed by a coroner.

"Former prime minister Abe was shot at around 11.30am," chief cabinet secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told reporters.

"One man, believed to be the shooter, has been taken into custody. The condition of former prime minister Abe is currently unknown," he added.

"Whatever the reason, such a barbaric act can never be tolerated, and we strongly condemn it."
